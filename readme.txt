how the function works:

The reduce_hash function takes a hash_value, an index, and a password_count as input. It returns a password from an array of passwords. The hash_value is a hash of the userâ€™s password, and the index is a value that is unique to the user. The int() function converts the hash_value from hexadecimal to an integer, and the % operator calculates the remainder of the division of (int(hash_value, 16) + index) by password_count. This value is used as an index to retrieve a password from the passwords array.

The find_preimage function takes a target_hash and a rainbow_table as input. It returns the original password that was hashed to produce the target_hash. If the target_hash is found in the rainbow_table, the function returns the corresponding password. Otherwise, the function generates a new hash by repeatedly applying the reduce_hash function to the target_hash for a fixed number of iterations. If the new hash is found in the rainbow_table, the function returns the corresponding password. If the password cannot be found, the function returns None.
